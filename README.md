Deskclock 2
===========

###### *Started July 31, 2022*

A replacement to my previous deskclock.  It has an LCD screen, buttons, a temperature
sensor, an IR receiver, and a USB connection to my desktop computer.  The computer is
running [Nerve](http://jabberwocky.ca/projects/nerve/), which can perform actions in
response to the buttons, and display information like the current time and current
song playing on my computer.
