- the idea is to replace my existing deskclock with something smaller and more permenent
- the main things I use from the existing one are the buttons, the LCD, and the temperature sensor (although it also has an IR
  receiver and LEDs (which I've never used))
- the existing one is a bit of a mess of wires, and with the new monitors being higher up, there's nothing to use to press against
  when pressing the keys, so it's less convenient to press them.  An improvement would be mounting them on top, so that pressing
  downwards could activate them, which wouldn't have the issue of pushing the whole thing backwards
- the headers on the existing buttons board being on the top side mean they can't be easily mounted inside a case facing upwards
- one thing that came up was the idea of having a digital pet (if the screen was capable of graphics).  Helena suggested Neko (code)
  There are lots of clones of the Neko animation, so maybe I could port it.  Might require a beefier controller though...
- STM32 boards seem to be pretty hard to come by because of the supply chain shortages.  There is a design online (no premade boards)
  called the OtterPill which is pin compatible with the Arduino Nano, so *maybe* possible to upgrade?


- possible improvements:
	- a longer LCD screen for temp as well as date?
	- maybe nicer buttons, possibly cherry mx switches?
	- smaller and more compact, possible inside some kind of case
	- maybe use a nano, with mini or microUSB to be less bulky??
	- I could possibly use an STM32 with rust running on it, but that doesn't provide much benefit, and arduino is better supported
	- looks like Adafruit has a 20x4 LCD RGB-on-black which would be a perfect upgrade to the existing one
	- an alternative is the Adafruit 2.8 inch graphics display with capacitive touch (added interaction through touch)
	- should you add a potentiometer input that could be repurposed for different things?  Either changing colour on RGB backlight, or headphone volume on computer?


- might need more pins... the 20x4 LCD requires a minimum of 6 digital lines for control, plus 3 PWM lines for the RGB backlight, and then
  you have 8 buttons on top of that, plus one for the temp sensor and one for the IR receiver.  You can multiplex the buttons using a
  parallel to serial convertor, which would reduce that to 2 pins, making a total of 10 digital pins + 3 PWM (instead of 16 + 3).

- I've started to settle on a 2.8" LCD, 320x240, 8 cherry mx buttons, possibly in sockets, in a 4 x 2 configuration running on the
  STM32F405 board, or possible the SAMD51 Feather, with other sensors and possible expansion with STEMMA/Qwiic
- LCD mounting holes should be about 15mm above board (with metal brackets)
