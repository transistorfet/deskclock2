 
Revision 1 Errata and Notes
===========================

- the IR receiver pinout has the power pins backwards, which causes the sensor to heat up and die

- the silkscreen button labels are the opposite order to what the button numbers are in firmware,
  where the computer side matches the firmware.  The "Next" button is B7 in software, but SW1 on
  the silkscreen.  I'm pretty sure the software ordering has carried on since the original
  deskclock
